## Hi, I’m Bala Maneesh Ayanala 👋

I build **local-first AI systems** and **computer vision solutions** with a strong focus on  
**privacy, system design, and real-world engineering constraints**.

I care more about **how systems are designed** than flashy demos.

---

### 🔧 What I build
- 🤖 **Local AI assistants** using Python & Ollama (Buddy AI)
- 🛰 **Satellite & SAR image denoising and enhancement**
- 🌐 **High-performance web interfaces**
- ⚙️ **Full-stack systems with clean architecture**

---

### 🧠 Engineering mindset
- Local-first > cloud-first (when privacy matters)
- Architecture before features
- Reproducibility over hype
- Honest trade-offs, no magic

---

### 🚀 Current focus
- Improving Buddy AI as a privacy-first local assistant
- Refining system architecture & documentation
- Turning research ideas into usable software
